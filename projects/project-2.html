            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>
                Commercial contractors rely on us to get the job done professionally and on time. Referred by a local sheet rock
                company, we painted this large home in North Augusta. The job included six rooms and the stairwell, and an interesting
                challenge in the form of an interior gable. Because the wood was newly cut, the sap required us to change from latex to
                oil-based paint to get the needed coverage. The client and contractor were very pleased with our work.

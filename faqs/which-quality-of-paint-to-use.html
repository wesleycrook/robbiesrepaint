                    <p>We use Sherwin-Williams paint, and there is a vast variety. Depending on the type of customer will determine the kind
                    of paint you need. If you are a commercial customer with hundreds of rental properties, you will need to keep your bill
                    low. Using cost-effective commercial paint such as <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/painting-contractors/products/promar-700-interior-latex" target="_blank">"Pro-mar 700"</a> is a good option for reaching those goals.</p>
                    
                    <p></p>Residential customers, you will need a mid-high grade paint to save you in the long run. A high-quality paint will last for many years and hold its color. I recommend a product line called <a href="https://www.sherwin-williams.com/architects-specifiers-designers/education/paint-and-color-technology/sw-art-pro-swcashmereint" target="_blank">"Cashmere"</a> it looks marvelous and goes on smooth.</p>
